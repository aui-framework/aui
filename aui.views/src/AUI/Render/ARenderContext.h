/**
 * @brief Render context passed to AView::render.
 * @details
 * View containers are responsible to modify (by withShiftedPosition) and passthrough clip optimization context in order
 * to determine which views do not affect actual renderbuffer image and thus should not be rendered either. It's
 * applicable for AScrollArea in the first place, or any other container with AOverflow::HIDDEN and a possibility to
 * either direct or indirect children to run out (render outside) of that container.
 *
 * View containers are also responsible to skip rendering of views that are outside of the clipping.
 *
 * ARenderContext is useful only for container views.
 * 
 * ARenderContext passed to the view (possibly AViewContainer) describes an axis aligned bounding box relative
 * to it's coordinate space (position).
 *
 * Root (window) and AOverflow::HIDDEN containers should create ARenderContext with position = {0, 0} and
 * size = it's size. Other containers should not affect ARenderContext and pass it to it's children as is, in
 * exception to position, which should be subtracted by view's position.
 *
 * See UIRenderOptimizationTest for tests.
