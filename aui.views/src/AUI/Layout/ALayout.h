/**
 * @brief Layout manager is an object that manages placement and size of @ref AView "views" inside
 * @ref AViewContainer "containers".
 * @defgroup layout_managers Layout Managers
 * @ingroup views
 * @details In AUI, layout building consists of layout managers. Layout manager determines position and size of
 * @ref AViewContainer "container"'s children @ref AView "views". A @ref AViewContainer "container" is a @ref AView
 * "view" that consists of other @ref AView "views", called children. In general, layout manager does not allow going
 * beyond the border of the @ref AViewContainer "container". A @ref AViewContainer "container" can be a child of an
 * another @ref AViewContainer "container" i.e., nesting is allowed.
 *
 * # Layout Examples
 *
 * @ref AHorizontalLayout "Horizontal" layout:
 * <table>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th>Code</th>
 *     <th>Result</th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>
 *       @code{cpp}
 *       setContents(
 *         Horizontal {
 *           _new<AButton>("1"),
 *           _new<AButton>("2"),
 *           _new<AButton>("3"),
 *         }
 *       );
 *       @endcode
 *     </td>
 *     <td><img src="https://github.com/aui-framework/aui/raw/master/docs/imgs/Screenshot_20210714_035347.png" /></td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * @ref AVerticalLayout "Vertical" layout:
 * <table>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th>Code</th>
 *     <th>Result</th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>
 *       @code{cpp}
 *       setContents(
 *         Vertical {
 *           _new<AButton>("1"),
 *           _new<AButton>("2"),
 *           _new<AButton>("3"),
 *         }
 *       );
 *       @endcode
 *     </td>
 *     <td><img src="https://github.com/aui-framework/aui/raw/master/docs/imgs/Screenshot_20210714_040046.png" /></td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * Since container can be child of other container, we can create complex UIs using basic layout managers:
 * <table>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th>Code</th>
 *     <th>Result</th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>
 *       @code{cpp}
 *       setContents(
 *         Vertical {
 *           _new<AButton>("Up"),
 *           Horizontal {
 *               _new<AButton>("Left"),
 *               _new<AButton>("Right"),
 *           },
 *           _new<AButton>("Down"),
 *         }
 *       );
 *       @endcode
 *     </td>
 *     <td><img src="https://github.com/aui-framework/aui/raw/master/docs/imgs/Screenshot_20210714_041807.png" /></td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * # Expanding
 * Expanding (often referred as stretch factor) is a property of any AView. Expanding is an expansion coefficient set on
 * per-axis basic (i.e, one value along x axis, another value along y axis), however it's convenient to set both values.
 * Hints layout manager how much this AView should be extended relative to other AViews in the same container.
 *
 * Horizontal layouts ignore y expanding of their children, Vertical layouts ignore x expanding of their children.
 *
 * Views are normally created without any expanding set. When Expanding views appear in a layout they are given a share
 * of space in accordance with their expanding or their minimum size whichever gives more space to them. Expanding is
 * used to change how much space views are given in proportion to one another.
 *
 * Expanding view does not affect parent's size or parent's expanding property. Use AView::setExpanding() on parent, or
 * `Expanding` variant of declarative container notation (`Vertical::Expanding`, `Horizontal::Expanding`,
 * `Stacked::Expanding`) for such case.
 *
 * Expanding views use free space of their container to grow.
 *
 * Free space of a container is determined by its size subtracted by sum of minimum sizes of its children. Please note
 * that your container would probably occupy minimum possible size (determined by minimum sizes of its children). It
 * order to make container larger than minimum possible size, you can specify FixedSize or MinSize or Expanding to the
 * container.
 *
 * You can use ass::Expanding @ref ass "ASS" property, or AView::setExpanding method to specify Expanding:
 * <table>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th>Code</th>
 *     <th>Result</th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>
 *       @code{cpp}
 *       setContents(
 *         Vertical {
 *           _new<AButton>("Up"),
 *           Horizontal {
 *             _new<AButton>("Left"),
 *             _new<AButton>("Center"),
 *             _new<AButton>("Right") let { it->setExpanding(); },
 *                  // alias to it->setExpanding(2) ^^^^^^
 *           },
 *           _new<AButton>("Down"),
 *         }
 *       );
 *       @endcode
 *     </td>
 *     <td><img src="https://github.com/aui-framework/aui/raw/master/docs/imgs/Screenshot_20210714_172900.png" /></td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * Expanding views push remaining views in their container:
 * <table>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th>Code</th>
 *     <th>Result</th>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>
 *       @code{cpp}
 *       setContents(
 *         Vertical {
 *           _new<AButton>("Up"),
 *           Horizontal {
 *               _new<AButton>("Left"),
 *               _new<AButton>("Center") let { it->setExpanding(); },
 *               _new<AButton>("Right"),
 *           },
 *           _new<AButton>("Down"),
 *         }
 *       );
 *       @endcode
 *     </td>
 *     <td><img src="https://github.com/aui-framework/aui/raw/master/docs/imgs/Screenshot_20210714_174121.png" /></td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * Expanding view does affect expanding environment inside a single container. If there's one view with expanding set to
 * any positive value it would occupy all free space in the container. If there is a view with expanding equal to 1 and
 * another view with expanding equal to 2 the first view would occupy one third of free space, the second view would
 * occupy two thirds of free space:
 * @code{cpp}
 * Vertical {
 *   _new<AButton>("Left") let { it->setExpanding(1); },
 *   _new<AButton>("Right") let { it->setExpanding(2); }, // will be twice as big as "Left"
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * You can use ASpacerExpanding as blank expanding view:
 * @code{cpp}
 * Vertical {
 *   _new<AButton>("Left"),
 *   SpacerExpanding(),
 *   _new<AButton>("Right"),
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note
 * FixedSize nullifies Expanding's action (on per axis basic).
