/**
 * @brief A trivial modifiable view that represents a set of views.
 * @ingroup useful_views
 * @details
 * AViewContainer can store, render, resize, provide events to and handle the child views.
 *
 * AViewContainer does not control the position and size of the child views by itself; instead, it delegates that
 * responsibility to it's @ref layout_managers "layout manager".
 *
 * Since AViewContainer is an instance of AView, AViewContainer can handle AViewContainers recursively, thus, making
 * possible complex UI by nested AViewContainers with different layout managers.
 *
 * @note
 * Consider using AViewContainerBase as a base class when possible. Use AViewContainer if you want to expose view
 * modifying methods such as addView, removeView, setContents, setLayout, etc. Use AViewContainerBase if these methods
 * might cause unwanted interference with implementation details of your view.
