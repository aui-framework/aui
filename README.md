Cross-platform high performance efficient module-based framework for developing and deploying hardware accelerated graphical desktop applications
using modern C++20.

The project is inspired by Qt and aims to provide developers with the best possible experience (including, but not limited
to: dependency management, packaging, ui building, styling, debugger visualizing) with pure C++, without custom
programming languages and external compilers.

# Quickstart

## Linux dependencies

If you are using Linux, install following dependencies:

### Debian/Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install pkg-config libglew-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libdbus-1-dev libfontconfig-dev ninja-build libpulse-dev git cmake g++
```

### Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf install fontconfig-devel gtk3-devel dbus-devel libXi libglvnd-devel libstdc++-static glew-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel git cmake g++
```

## AUI App Template âš¡

Use our setup-free repository templates for quick start:

1. [Minimal UI](https://github.com/aui-framework/example_minimal_ui) - an absolute minimum to start a graphical UI application, without any boilerplate.
2. [Minimal UI with assets](https://github.com/aui-framework/example_assets_ui) - same as above but with assets.
3. [Full-fledged App Template](https://aui-framework.github.io/develop/example_app_template.html) - a complete template to create a GitHub-hosted app project with CI/CD building,
   testing, releasing, auto updating, code quality checking and more.

## Integrating AUI to existing CMake project

To link AUI to your project, use the following CMake script. This script is self sufficient and does not require additional setup, AUI is imported to your project thanks to
[AUI.Boot](https://aui-framework.github.io/develop/md_docs_2AUI_01Boot.html).

`CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
# Standard routine
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(aui_app)

set(AUI_VERSION v9.3.0)

# Use AUI.Boot
file(
        DOWNLOAD
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aui-framework/aui/${AUI_VERSION}/aui.boot.cmake
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/aui.boot.cmake)
include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/aui.boot.cmake)

# import AUI
auib_import(aui https://github.com/aui-framework/aui
        COMPONENTS core views
        VERSION ${AUI_VERSION})


# Create the executable. This function automatically links all sources from the src/ folder,
# creates CMake target and places the resulting executable to bin/ folder.
aui_executable(${PROJECT_NAME})

# Link required libs
aui_link(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE aui::core aui::views)
```

`src/main.cpp`:
```cpp
#include <AUI/Platform/Entry.h>
#include <AUI/Platform/AWindow.h>
#include <AUI/Util/UIBuildingHelpers.h>
#include <AUI/View/ALabel.h>
#include <AUI/View/AButton.h>
#include <AUI/Platform/APlatform.h>

using namespace declarative;

AUI_ENTRY {
    auto w = _new<AWindow>("Window title", 300_dp, 200_dp);
    w->setContents(Centered {
      Vertical {
        Centered { Label { "Hello world from AUI!" } },
        Centered {
          Button { "Visit GitHub page" }.clicked(w, [] {
              APlatform::openUrl("https://github.com/aui-framework/aui");
          }),
        },
      },
    });
    w->show();
    return 0;
}
```
