Cross-platform high performance efficient module-based framework for developing and deploying hardware accelerated graphical desktop applications
using modern C++20.

The project aims to provide developers with the best possible experience (including, but not limited to: dependency
management, packaging, ui building, styling, debugger visualizing).

# Quickstart

## Linux dependencies

If you are using Linux, install following dependencies:

### Ubuntu
```bash
sudo apt install pkg-config libfontconfig-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libglew-dev libstdc++-static libpulse-dev libdbus-1-dev
```

### Fedora
```bash
sudo dnf install fontconfig-devel libXi libglvnd-devel libstdc++-static glew-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel
```

## Your project CMake script

To link AUI to your project, use the following CMake script:

`CMakeLists.txt`:
```cmake
# Standard routine
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)
project(aui_app)


# Tip: in a production project don't use branch name, use a specific name tag (i.e. v1.1.1),
# but for a sandbox project branch name is perfectly enough
set(AUI_VERSION master)

# Use AUI.Boot
file(
        DOWNLOAD
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aui-framework/aui/${AUI_VERSION}/aui.boot.cmake
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/aui.boot.cmake)
include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/aui.boot.cmake)

# import AUI
auib_import(aui https://github.com/aui-framework/aui
        COMPONENTS core views
        VERSION ${AUI_VERSION})


# Create the executable. This function automatically links all sources from the src/ folder,
# creates CMake target and places the resulting executable to bin/ folder.
aui_executable(${PROJECT_NAME})

# Link required libs
aui_link(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE aui::core aui::views)
```

`src/main.cpp`:
```cpp
#include <AUI/Platform/Entry.h>
#include <AUI/Platform/AWindow.h>
#include <AUI/Util/UIBuildingHelpers.h>
#include <AUI/View/ALabel.h>
#include <AUI/View/AButton.h>
#include <AUI/Platform/APlatform.h>

using namespace declarative;

AUI_ENTRY {
    auto w = _new<AWindow>("Window title", 300_dp, 200_dp);
    w->setContents(Centered {
      Vertical {
        Centered { Label { "Hello world from AUI!" } },
        Centered {
          Button { "Visit GitHub page" }.clicked(w, [] {
              APlatform::openUrl("https://github.com/aui-framework/aui");
          }),
        },
      },
    });
    w->show();
    return 0;
}
```
