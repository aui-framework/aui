iOS is an operating system developed by Apple, designed for their mobile devices such as iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.
It provides a secure, user-friendly interface to manage apps, files, music, photos, and other content.

@warning
At the moment, support of iOS in AUI Framework is in early stage and lacks a lot of features.

iOS shares its XNU kernel and codebase with @ref macos.

## Key considerations

- iOS is easier to support than @ref android due to limited number of devices and OS versions
- You'd need a @ref macos machine to build and run an iOS app
