# iOS (operating system)

iOS is an operating system developed by Apple, designed for their mobile devices such as iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.
It provides a secure, user-friendly interface to manage apps, files, music, photos, and other content.


!!! bug "Early Access Feature"

    At the moment, support of iOS in AUI Framework is in early stage and lacks a lot of features.

iOS shares its XNU kernel and codebase with [macos.md].

## Key considerations

- iOS is easier to support than [android.md] due to limited number of devices and OS versions
- You'd need a [macos.md] machine to build and run an iOS app
