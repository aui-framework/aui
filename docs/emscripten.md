@page emscripten Emscripten (WebAssembly)
@details
Emscripten is a compiler that converts C and C++ code into WebAssembly, allowing it to run efficiently in web browsers.
It emulates a POSIX operating system and supports the C standard library. Now Emscripten can also be used for non-web
applications due to new technologies like WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) and runtimes.

@warning
At the moment, support of WebAssembly in AUI Framework is in early stage and lacks a lot of features.
