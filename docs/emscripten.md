Emscripten is a compiler that converts C and C++ code into WebAssembly, allowing it to run efficiently in web browsers.
It emulates a POSIX operating system and supports the C standard library. Now Emscripten can also be used for non-web
applications due to new technologies like WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) and runtimes.
