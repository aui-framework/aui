AUI's codebase and documentation refer to the family of operating systems based on the Linux kernel with Freedesktop
technology stack, which (mostly) excludes @ref android.

Linux is a family of open-source operating systems based on the Linux kernel. It comes in various distributions
(distros) that include software and libraries from third parties, with the most popular ones being Debian, Fedora,
Ubuntu, and others. There are thousands of distros, which can be commercial or free.

Key components of a distribution include the display server (desktop only), package manager, bootloader, and Unix shell.
When developing an app for Linux, it's essential to consider the various variants, including different initialization
systems, windowing systems, desktop environments, and hardware drivers, due to its customizability options and low
number of desktop users.
