@page macos macOS (operating system)
@details
macOS is a series of proprietary operating systems developed by Apple for their own hardware. It's designed
exclusively for the Apple ecosystem, providing users with a powerful and user-friendly platform to operate their
devices.

@warning
At the moment, support of macOS in AUI Framework is in early stage and lacks a lot of features.

macOS shares its XNU kernel and codebase with @ref ios.

Due to closed nature of Apple platforms, a single macOS machine is considered as the only option for AUI/application
development for all supported platforms at once:
- @ref macos "macOS" - natively (obviously)
- @ref ios "iOS" - natively (via Xcode)
- @ref android "Android" - natively (via Android Studio)
- @ref windows "Windows" - via VM
- @ref linux "Linux" - via VM
- @ref emscripten - natively
