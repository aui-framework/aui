@details
macOS is a series of proprietary operating systems developed by Apple for their own hardware. It's designed
exclusively for the Apple ecosystem, providing users with a powerful and user-friendly platform to operate their
devices.

@warning
At the moment, support of macOS in AUI Framework is in early stage and lacks a lot of features.

macOS shares its XNU kernel and codebase with @ref ios.

Due to closed nature of Apple platforms, a single macOS machine is considered as the only option for AUI/application
development for all supported platforms at once:
- @ref macos "macOS" - natively (obviously)
- @ref ios "iOS" - natively (via Xcode)
- @ref android "Android" - natively (via Android Studio)
- @ref windows "Windows" - via VM
- @ref linux "Linux" - via VM
- @ref emscripten - natively

# Key considerations

- You'd want to support both architectures - `x86_64` and Apple Silicon `arm64` by producing universal binaries
- Application menu is located in system's top bar instead of being inside the window
- macOS hardware offers high density displays (marketing name: Retina), so you need to use density-independent dimension
  units such as @ref AMetric "_dp"
- Apple laptops include high quality touchpads with high resolution scroll and possibility for multitouch gestures
