AUI Framework provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for building robust, scalable, and maintainable user
interfaces. With its modular architecture and extensive feature set, developers can create complex UI components with
ease. See @ref "docs/Getting started with AUI.md" for quick start.

# Views

@ref useful_views "Views" are basic units to build UIs with AUI. There is a wide range of pre-built views for common UI
elements, such as buttons, labels, and text inputs.

# Event handling with signal-slot

@ref signal_slot can be used to handle UI events and respond to them accordingly.

```cpp
mOkButton = _new<AButton>("OK");
connect(mOkButton->clicked, [] { 
    ALogger::info("Example") << "The button was clicked";
});
```

# Data Binding

@ref property_system "Data binding", based on @ref signal_slot "signal-slot", allows to establish a connection between
UI and application data objects.
