The app icon is an important part of any software product, representing your brand identity and conveying the purpose of
your project. It's often one of the first things users see when they discover a new application, setting a tone for
overall user experience. Approach to app icon briefly resembles the overall quality of the product.

While making distinct visuals for every platform can be challenging, AUI is here to help you to produce
professional-grade app icons while preserving targeted platform's specifics.

# Abstract

Modern operating systems tend to enforce icon shape to unify their launchers. For example, iOS is known for its
distinctive "squircle" shape, a unique combination of square and circle with subtle curvature that deviates from the
more traditional rounded rectangle. In Android the user is allowed to choose between rectangle, rounded rectangle,
circle and squircle shapes. Moreover, it features a clear distinction between background and foreground layers so the
icon can be animated.

For that being said, a typical shape-agnostic app icon consists of:

- a **background** layer which is a neutral solid color, such as black or white, or featuring an accent color.
  Occasionally, it may incorporate gradients or abstract shapes to add visual interest. As the background layer often
  gets masked, its simplicity is key - it doesn't clutter the icon with important visual information, instead using
  colors playfully.
- a **foreground** layer that typically holds a logo or other critical graphics. To ensure clean look it should be
  padded to fit naturally within icon's boundary which as was mentioned may differ.

On the other hand, Windows and Linux applications tend to have non-uniform shapes.
