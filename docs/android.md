Android is a mobile operating system primarily developed by Google. It's the most widely used operating system in the
world with over three billion monthly active users.

@warning
At the moment, support of Android in AUI Framework is in early stage and lacks a lot of features.

The core operating system, known as AOSP, is free and open-source, but most devices run Google's proprietary version of
Android.

Its ecosystem includes apps like Google Chrome and Google Play Store, which are pre-installed on many devices. Modified
distributions exist, such as Amazon Fire OS and LineageOS, and it has been used to develop operating systems for various
electronics like TVs and wearables.

Android shares its kernel with @ref linux, but is not treated by AUI exactly as Linux.
