# AUI Framework

Welcome to AUI framework documentation!

AUI is cross-platform high performance efficient module-based framework for developing and deploying hardware accelerated graphical desktop applications
using modern C++20.

The project is inspired by Qt and aims to provide developers with the best possible experience (including, but not limited
to: dependency management, packaging, ui building, styling, debugger visualizing) with pure C++, without custom
programming languages and external compilers.
