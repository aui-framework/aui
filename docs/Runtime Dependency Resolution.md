Runtime dependencies are files that are required by your application execution. Typically those files are program
modules such as `*.dll`, `*.so` or `*.dylib`.

@note
Runtime dependencies are not easy to deploy and might require tinkering. For icons, images, sounds and other resources
consider using AUI assets to embed them right into your binary.
