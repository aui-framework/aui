Challenges: change propagation, widget customization, implementing a more authentic/involved GUI application.

The task is to create a simple but usable spreadsheet application. The spreadsheet should be scrollable. The rows should
be numbered from 0 to 99 and the columns from A to Z. Double-clicking a cell C lets the user change C’s formula. After
having finished editing the formula is parsed and evaluated and its updated value is shown in C. In addition, all cells
which depend on C must be reevaluated. This process repeats until there are no more changes in the values of any cell (
change propagation). Note that one should not just recompute the value of every cell but only of those cells that depend
on another cell’s changed value. If there is an already provided spreadsheet widget it should not be used. Instead,
another similar widget (like JTable in Swing) should be customized to become a reusable spreadsheet widget.

Cells is a more authentic and involved task that tests if a particular approach also scales to a somewhat bigger
application. The two primary GUI-related challenges are intelligent propagation of changes and widget customization.
Admittedly, there is a substantial part that is not necessarily very GUI-related but that is just the nature of a more
authentic challenge. A good solution’s change propagation will not involve much effort and the customization of a widget
should not prove too difficult. The domain-specific code is clearly separated from the GUI-specific code. The resulting
spreadsheet widget is reusable.
