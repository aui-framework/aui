/**
 * @defgroup signal_slot Signal-slot
 * @ingroup core
 * @brief Signal-slots is an object messaging mechanism that creates seamless relations between objects.
 * @details Signal-slots were originally implemented in Qt and it has proven themselves as an object messaging mechanism
 * making it easy to implement the observer pattern without boilerplate code.
 * Signal-slot tracks object existence on the both ends so destruction of either sender or receiver object breaks the
 * link between them. When the sender or receiver object is destroyed slot execution is never possible even in a
 * multithreaded environment. Almost any signal can be connected to almost any slot (even lambda) by any code.
 *
 * All classes that inherit from AObject or one of its subclasses (e.g., AView) can contain signals and slots. Signals
 * are emitted by objects when they change their state in a way that may be interesting to other objects. This is all
 * the object does to communicate. It does not know or care whether anything is receiving the signals it emits. This is
 * true information encapsulation, and ensures that the object can be used as a software component.
 *
 * @ref emits "Signal declarations" are special public fields of any class that inherit from AObject.
 * @code{cpp}
 * class Counter: public AObject {
 * public:
 *   Counter() = default;
 *
 *   void setValue(int value) {
 *     mValue = value;
 *     emit valueChanged;
 *   }
 *
 * signals:
 *   emits<> valueChanged;
 *
 * private:
 *   int mValue = 0;
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * They can specify arguments:
 * @code{cpp}
 * emits<int> valueChanged;
 * ...
 * emit valueChanged(mValue);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Any member function of a class can be used as a slot.
 *
 * You can connect as many signals as you want to a single slot, and a signal can be connected to as many slots as you
 * need.
 *
 * # Signals
 * Signals are publicly accessible fields that notify an object's client when its internal state has changed in some way
 * that might be interesting or significant. These signals can be emitted from various locations, but it is generally
 * recommended to only emit them from within the class that defines the signal and its subclasses.
 *
 * The slots connected to a signal are generaly executed immediately when the signal is emitted like a regular function
 * call. \c emit returns control after all slots are called. If receiver has AObject::setSlotsCallsOnlyOnMyThread set to
 * true and \c emit was called on a different thread, \c emit queues slot execution to the AEventLoop associated with
 * receiver's thread. All AView have this behaviour enabled by default.
 *
 * # Slots
 * A slot is triggered by the emission of a related signal. Slot is no more than a regular class method with a signal
 * connected to it.
 *
 * When called directly, slots follow standard C++ rules and syntax. However, through a signal-slot connection, any
 * component can invoke a slot regardless of its accessibility level. Visibility scope matters only when creating
 * connection (AObject::connect). This means a signal from one class can call a private slot in another unrelated class
 * if connection is created within class itself (with access to its private/protected methods).
 *
 * Furthermore, slots can be defined as virtual functions, which have been found to be beneficial in practical
 * application development.
 *
 * Compared to callbacks, the signals and slots system has some performance overhead due to its increased flexibility.
 * The difference is typically insignificant for real-world applications. In general, emitting a signal connected to
 * various slots can result in an execution time roughly ten times slower than direct function calls. This delay comes
 * from locating the connection object and safely iterating over connections.
 *
 * The trade-off between the signals and slots mechanism's simplicity and flexibility compared to pure function calls or
 * callbacks is well-justified for most applications, given its minimal performance cost that users won't perceive.
 *
 * # Basic example
 * Let's use \c Counter from our previous example:
 * @code{cpp}
 * class Counter: public AObject {
 * public:
 *   Counter() = default;
 *
 *   void setValue(int value) {
 *     mValue = value;
 *     emit valueChanged(value);
 *   }
 *
 * signals:
 *   emits<int> valueChanged;
 *
 * private:
 *   int mValue = 0;
 * };
 *
 * class MyApp: public AObject {
 * public:
 *   MyApp() {}
 *
 *   void run() {
 *     connect(mCounter->valueChanged, this, &MyApp::printCounter);
 *     mCounter->setValue(123); // prints "New value: 123"
 *   }
 *
 * private:
 *   _<Counter> mCounter = _new<Counter>();
 *
 *   void printCounter(int value) {
 *     ALogger::info("MyApp") << value;
 *   }
 * };
 *
 * AUI_ENTRY {
 *   auto app = _new<MyApp>();
 *   app->run();
 *   return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * If `connect(mCounter->valueChanged, this, &MyApp::printCounter);` looks too long for you, you can use
 * @ref slot "slot" macro:
 * @code{cpp}
 * connect(mCounter->valueChanged, slot(this)::printCounter);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Furthermore, when connecting to `this`, slot(this) can be replaced with @ref me "me":
 * @code{cpp}
 * connect(mCounter->valueChanged, me::printCounter);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Lambda can be used as a slot either:
 * @code{cpp}
 * connect(mCounter->valueChanged, this, [](int value) {
 *   ALogger::info("MyApp") << value;
 * });
 * @endcode
 *
 * As with methods, `this` can be omitted:
 * @code{cpp}
 * connect(mCounter->valueChanged, [](int value) {
 *   ALogger::info("MyApp") << value;
 * });
 * @endcode
 *
 *
 * # UI example
 * Knowing basics of signal slots, you can now utilize UI signals:
 * @code{cpp}
 * mOkButton = _new<AButton>("OK");
 * ...
 * connect(mOkButton->clicked, [] { // the signal is connected to "this" object
 *     ALogger::info("Example") << "The button was clicked";
 * });
 * @endcode
 *
 * @note
 * In lambda, do not capture shared pointer (AUI's _) of signal emitter or receiver object by value. This would cause
 * a memory leak:
 * @code
 * mOkButton = _new<AButton>("OK");
 * ...
 * connect(mOkButton->clicked, [view] { // WRONG!!!
 *     view->setText("clicked");
 * });
 * @endcode
 * Do this way:
 * @code
 * mOkButton = _new<AButton>("OK");
 * ...
 * connect(mOkButton->clicked, [view = view.get()] { // ok
 *     view->setText("clicked");
 * });
 * @endcode
 *
 * ## Going further
 * Let's take our previous example with `Counter` and make an UI app. Signal slot reveals it's power when your objects
 * have small handy functions, so lets add `increase` method to our counter:
 *
 * @code{cpp}
 * class Counter: public AObject {
 * public:
 *   Counter() = default;
 *
 *   void setValue(int value) {
 *     mValue = value;
 *     emit valueChanged(value);
 *   }
 *
 *   void increase() {
 *     setValue(mCounter + 1);
 *   }
 *
 * signals:
 *   emits<int> valueChanged;
 *
 * private:
 *   int mValue = 0;
 * };
 *
 * class MyApp: public AWindow {
 * public:
 *   MyApp() {
 *     auto label = _new<ALabel>("-");
 *     auto button = _new<AButton>("Increase");
 *
 *     using namespace declarative;
 *     setContents(Vertical {
 *       label,
 *       button,
 *     });
 *
 *     connect(button->clicked, slot(mCounter)::increase); // beauty, huh?
 *     connect(mCounter->valueChanged, label, [label = label.get()](int value) {
 *       label->setText("{}"_format(value));
 *     });
 *   }
 *
 * private:
 *   _<Counter> mCounter = _new<Counter>();
 * };
 *
 * AUI_ENTRY {
 *   auto app = _new<MyApp>();
 *   app->show();
 *   return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * This way, by clicking on "Increase", it would increase the counter and immediately display value via label.
 *
 * Let's make things more declarative and use @ref let "let" syntax to set up connections:
 * @code{cpp}
 * MyApp() {
 *   using namespace declarative;
 *   setContents(Vertical {
 *     _new<ALabel>("-") let {
 *       connect(counter->valueChanged, label, [label = it.get()](int value) {
 *         label->setText("{}"_format(value));
 *       });
 *     },
 *     _new<AButton>("Increase") let {
 *       connect(it->clicked, slot(mCounter)::increase);
 *     },
 *   });
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * See also @ref property_system for making reactive UI's on trivial data.
 *
 * # Arguments
 * If signal declares arguments (i.e, like AView::keyPressed), you can accept them:
 * @code{cpp}
 * view = _new<ATextField>();
 * ...
 * connect(view->keyPressed, [](AInput::Key k) { // the signal is connected to "this" object
 *     ALogger::info("Example") << "Key was pressed: " << k;
 * });
 * @endcode
 *
 * The signals and slots mechanism is type safe: The signature of a signal must match the signature of the receiving
 * slot. Also, a slot may have a shorter signature than the signal it receives because it can ignore extra arguments:
 * @code{cpp}
 * view = _new<ATextField>();
 * ...
 * connect(view->keyPressed, [] { // the signal is connected to "this" object
 *     ALogger::info("Example") << "Key was pressed";
 * });
 * @endcode
 *
 * # Differences between Qt and AUI implementation

 * <code>showMessage</code> slot:
