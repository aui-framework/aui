/**
 * @brief An exception that thrown when non-c++ unhandled error occurs (i.e. access violation).
 * @ingroup core
 * @details
 * @note AFatalException::setGlobalHandler is supported on all platforms, but translation to AFatalError is not as it
 * uses compiler-specific flags and hacks. See @ref "Platform support" for further info.
 *
 * Translation to throwing AFatalException recovers the application from crashed state, providing you ability to handle
 * such errors and continue normal application execution. However, still recommended to handle such errors with
 * setGlobalHandler() to at least save user data.
 *
 * # Platform support
 * | Platform | Translation to throwing AFatalException | setGlobalHandler() |

 * | Windows  | MSVC                                    | +                  |
 * | Linux    | GCC                                     | +                  |

     * @brief Sets handler for fatal exceptions.
     * @param globalHandler handler
     * @details
     * The handler is called inside OS's signal callback, thus, it's not recommended to use the following operations
     * during callback execution:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>I/O (printf, logging, fopen, fread, fwrite, etc...)</li>
     *   <li>Heap routines (malloc, free, new, delete), including heap-based containers (std::vector, std::list,
     *   std::queue, etc...)</li>
     *   <li>System calls (time, getcwd, etc...)</li>
     * </ul>
     * Basically, you may want to define global AOptional&lt;AFatalException&gt; and store the copy of exception in
     * order to process it outside of the callback.
     *
     * The callback may be used for handling and sending telemetry data (however, be aware of using unrecommended
     * operations).
