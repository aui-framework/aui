/**
 * @brief A thread safe buffer that converts an IInputStream to IOutputStream (and otherwise).
 * @ingroup core
 * @ingroup io
 * @details
 * APipe is similar to the unix pipes. It's capable to store up to 65,536 bytes. It's implemented like a ring buffer.
 * If this limit is reached, a write() method blocks thread until buffer is read from.
 *
 * If capacity may be not enough, consider to use ADynamicPipe instead.
