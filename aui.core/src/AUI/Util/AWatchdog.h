/**
 * @brief Watchdog helper class.
 * @ingroup core
 * @details
 * Watchdog is either hardware or software (as in this case) module which detects hangs of subject (in this case,
 * of a callback).
 *
 * AWatchdog catches ANR (Application Not Responsive) errors in GUI AUI applications.
 *
 * It's important to periodically call AWatchdog::isHang in order to check for hangs. It can be done via separate
 * thread or AUI's timers (separate thread is more reliable).
 *
 * @see AWatchdog::run
 * @see AWatchdog::isHang
