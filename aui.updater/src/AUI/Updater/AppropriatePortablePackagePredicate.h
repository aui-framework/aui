         * used.
         *
         * Since AUI is only capable of unpacking ZIPs, this predicate checks for ".zip" extension.
         *
         * Implemented as AString::contains with an additional check that "_" does not goes after, to distinguish
         * `x86_64` and `x86`.
         *
         * Linux x86_64 -> `linux-x86_64`
         * Windows arm64 -> `windows-arm64`
         *
         * If you wish to publish portable packages with different qualifiers, you must specify it to this variable.
         * As AUI's package name, it's convenient to evaluate the package name in CMake and pass it to your target
         * with `target_compile_definitions`.
